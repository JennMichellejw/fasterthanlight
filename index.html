                    <p>Faster than Light is a real-time strategy rouge like game. It was created by a indie studio called Subset Games. The premise of the game is that in the midst of a war between a xenophobic rebel faction and the Galactic Federation, you are piloting a ship which belongs to the Federation, and is carrying critical information about how to defeat the rebels. While being pursued by the rebel fleet, you must fight your way through 8 sectors, which may be civilian, nebula, or hostile territories. Sector 9 is taken over by rebels, but you must reach the Federation headquarters and defeat the rebel boss ship before they destroy the base in order to win.</br>Though I don't consider myself a 'gamer', people have referred to me as such because of the amount of time I have spent playing FTL. The reason FTL quickly became my favorite game is because of how challenging it is. The average player can expect to win &lt; 10% of games. As the loading screen says: "Losing is part of the fun!". </p>

                <h2>Alien Races</h2>
                <div id = "alienRaceIntro">
                    <img src = "./images/Ftlraces.png"style="width:200px;height:200px;" ><p>There are 8 different Alien races in FTL. They each have starting stats which can be leveled up: Piloting, Engines, Shields, Weapons, Repair, and Combat. Each race has their pros and cons, and they all have unique events in the game which are unlocked by having them as part of your crew. The best crew is a diverse one with many different species. The Maximum crew size is 8.</p>
                </div>
                <div class = "alienRaceGroup">
                    <h3>Humans</h3><img src="./images/MaleHuman3.png">
                        <p>Humans are the most boring of the races. Not to mention the rebels are made up of mostly human scum. To be fair, they do have their merits. Well, one at least: Humans are fast learners, their stats level up fast. They also only have one special event, while other species have many.</p>
                </div>
                <div class = "alienRaceGroup">
                    <h3>Engi</h3><img src = "./images/Engi1.png">
                        <p>Engis are engineers, they are mostly made of machinery. They are a great asset to your crew because they are an intelligent race, and their repair speed is double that of any other race. The downfall of Engi is that they are fragile, and their combat damage inflicted is halved. Engis are most useful to have in the engine room, piloting, or shields, as those are most important to repair quickly. It is important to have a strong crew member on board, or drones so Engi can avoid conflict.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class = "alienRaceGroup">
                <h3>Mantis</h3><img src = "./images/Mantis5.png">
                    <p>They are in general a hostile race, and are out for themselves. However, occasionally you can find a Mantis who supports The Federation. Mantis are warriors. They deal 150% the amount of damage, and their speed is 1.2X than that of other races. The downfall of Mantis is that their repair speed is halved. So it is best to have crew with faster repair speed, or a repair drone. Mantis are great to be used as boarding crew, they can be transported to an enemy ship and kill the enemy. </p>
                </div>
                <div class = "alienRaceGroup">
                    <h3>Rockmen</h3><img src = "./images/Rockmen1.png">
                        <p>In my opinion, Rockmen are the most difficult species to play. They are a very aggressive, violent race, although as with the Mantis, you occasionally run into friendly Rockmen. Rockmen are a resilient and strong race. They are immune to fire damage, and their health is 150 as opposed to 100 like the other races. The downfall of Rockmen is that their speed is halved. I find this is be inconvenient and not worth the benefits. Due to my personal playing styles, I have a lot of close calls. Which is made much worse by having slow crew members.</p>
                </div>
                <div class = "alienRaceGroup">                
                    <h3>Zolton</h3> <img src = "./images/Zoltan5.png">
                        <p>Zoltons are a species which is made of mostly pure energy. They are an ally of the Engi, and they are conflicted about The Federation. They are a peaceful, just people, and avoid conflict when possible. The Zolton, being made of mostly energy, have the ability to provide one bar of power to the system in the room they are in at any given time. They also explode upon death and deal 15 damage to enemies in the room. The downfall of Zolton is that their health is much lower that other races, and just 70 hp. Although to me, the Zolton aren't as useful as other species, they are intelligent species, and have created ways to make up for their faults by creating a stronger shield which is equip on most of their ships.</p>
                <div class = "alienRaceGroup">     
                    <h3>Slug</h3> <img src= "./images/Slug5.png">
                        <p>The Slug races tends to keep to themselves, though when they are encountered they should be approached with caution. Slugs are deceitful and greedy. They reside mostly in nebula sectors, and are assumed to be up to no good when encountered in other sectors. If you happen to end up with a Slug crew member, they are beneficial, especially for navigating nebula sectors. Slugs have telepathic abilities, which allow them to have more vision when sensors are down. They are able to detect the location of crew on enemy ships, and they are able to see any room which is touching the room they are currently standing in. This is beneficial because sensors do not work inside of nebulas. Because of this ability, Slugs are also immune to mind control, which is available in the Advanced Edition of FTL.</p>
                </div>
                <div class = "alienRaceGroup">
                    <h3>Crystal</h3> <img src = "./images/Crystal4.png">
                        <p>The Crystal race are the ancestors of the Rockmen. However, the Crystal race denounced the Rockmens violent ways and isolated themselves from the galaxy. They are very rare and the only way to obtain a Crystal crew member is by happening upon a series of special events which will unlock a single Crystal crew member. Crystal crew members have a Lockdown ability, which can lockdown a room they are in for 12 seconds. This can come in handy is there is enemy crew on your ship and you need to protect certain systems. As with Rockmen, they are immune to fire damage, and their suffocation damage is halved. They also have increased health points at 125. Their only downfall is that speed is 20% reduced.</p>
                 </div>
                 <div class = "alienRaceGroup">    
                   <h3>Lanius</h3><img src = "./images/Lanius3.png">
                        <p>Lanius is also a very rare race. Lanius are a metallic species, and they rely on leaching minerals to survive. Their society often hibernates for many years until they encounter a significant metal deposit, and they mostly keep to themselves when they are not in hibernation. The war has awoken the Lanius race in the Advanced Edition of Faster Than Light. Due to the Lanius biology, they leach oxygen out of any room they are in, which depending on your crew can be a good or bad this. Because of this, they take no damage from lack of oxygen. They also have a reduced movement speed. Though they are an interesting race, I am not a huge fan of Lanius crew members.</p>

                    <p class = "shipinfo">The Engi ship in my opinion is one of the most difficult ships. The initial layout of this ship is manned by a 3 man crew with two Engi and one Human.

                <a name = "sectors"></a>
                <h2>Sectors</h2>
                <img src = "./images/sectormap.jpg">
                <p>There are benefits to each different sector. You will encounter fewer battles in friendly sectors, but you may get less scrap (which is currency) and items. In hostile sectors you will encounter more enemies, therefor you will have more opportunities to gather scrap. Nebula sectors have many nebulas which slow down the rebel fleet, and disable sensors. They tend to be neutral territories, and a great opportunity to find Slug crew members.</p>
                <h3>Civilian sectors</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Civilian sector - Mostly neutral encounters.</li>
                        <li>Engi controlled or homeworlds - Engi are sympathetic to The Federation, so there are plenty of opportunity for scrap, and will be a mostly safe journey</li>
                        <li>Zolton controlled and homeworlds - These sectors are a more hostile friendly territory. The Zolton are defensive, though fair.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Hostile sectors</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mantis controlled and homeworlds - Mantis are slavers, so these sectors are a good place to find crew members by liberating the Mantis slaves.</li>
                            <li>Rock controlled and homeworlds - These sectors are neutral - hostile. They are a great way to get scrap and weapons.</li>
                            <li>Pirate controlled - These sectors are inhabited by multiple races and are good for finding scrap and equipment.</li>
                            <li>Rebel controlled and stronghold - These sectors are full of Rebel scum. They are a dangerous sector, but as with most hostile sectors, lots of scrap.</li>
                            <li>Abandoned Sector- These sectors are home of the Lanius, and contain a lot of unique events. Abandoned sectors are neutral - hostile, and are the only way to find Lanius crew.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h3>Nebula sectors</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Slug controlled and homeworld - These sectors are especially hostile. They are a great way to get Slug crew members.</li>
                            <li>Uncharted nebula sector - These sectors are mostly neutral. They are also home to Slugs.</li>

                <h2>Weapons</h2>
                <p>There are many different types of weapons including: lasers, beams, flax, missiles, bombs, and ion weapons. Different types of weapons can be used together to deal maximun damage. My personal favorite is a combination of flak and beam weapons.</p>
                <h3>Lasers</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><img src="./images/Burst_Laser_II.png"> Burst Lasers shoot multiple shots and have a quick cool down time.</li>
                        <li><img src = "./images/Heavy_Laser_II (1).png">Heavy lasers do breach and fire damage</li>

                    </ul>
                <h3>Flak</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><img src = "./images/Flak_Gun_II.png">Flak weapons have terrible aim, but shoots multiple pieces of debris at energy ships.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Beams</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><img src = "./images/Fire_Beam.png"> fire beams don't do any hull or system damage, but they do fire damage to multiple rooms.</li>
                        <li><img src = "./images/Glaive.png"> Beam weapons do damage to multiple rooms, some of them, such as the Glaive, are strong enough to do damage through shields.</li>

                    </ul>
                <h3>Missile</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><img src = "./images/Hermes,_Breach,_Hull_Missiles.png">Missile weapons do breach and sometimes fire damage, as well as damage to hull and systems. Most Missile weapons can bypass low level shields. These weapons require missiles</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Bombs</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><img src = "./images/Breach_Bomb_1&2.png">Bombs are teleported directly onto enemy ships. They do damage to personnel, as well as systems and hull. Many Bombs do breach damage as well.</li>
                        <li><img src = "./images/Ion_Bomb.png">Ion bombs do ion damage, which shuts down systems in the targeted room.</li>

                <h3>Events</h3>
                <p>There are many different random events in the game. The events depends on which sector you're in. There may be special highlighted actions you can take depending on your crew members. The events and outcomes are random, though you can occasionally predict the outcome depending on the event and your crew. My favorite events are those where you help civilians, because good deeds make you feel good, and events win which you help The Federation, because they generally send you to a federation base nearby where you get free scrap and repairs.</p>
