            <h1>About Faster Than Light, and why I love it.</h1>
                <p>Faster than Light is a real-time statagy rouge like game. It was created by a indie studio called Subset Games. The premise of the game is that in the midst of a war between a xenophobic rebel faction and the Galactic Federation, you are piloting a ship which belogs to the Federation, and is carrying critical information about how to defeat the rebels. While being pursued by the rebel fleet, you must fight your way through 8 sectors, which may be friendly, nutural, or hostile territories. Sector 9 is taken over by rebels, but you must reach the Federation headquarters and defeat the rebel boss ship before they destroy the base in order to win.<br>Though I don't consider myself a 'gamer', people have refered to me as such because of the amount of time I have spent playing FTL. The reason FTL quickly became my favorite game is because of how challanging it is. The average player can expect to win &lt; of games </p>
